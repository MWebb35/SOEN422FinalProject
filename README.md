# SOEN422FinalProject

Problem: Studying is a known cause of stress at university and is one of the leading reasons that students do not complete their degrees. 8 out of 10 students in the UK report stress/anxiety about their academic lives (Bouchrika, 2023), whilst 89% of surveyed students in Canada report feeling overwhelemed by their responsibilties (Abdi, 2023). This system will aim to ease the stress felt by studying by incorporating known effective studying techniques into an interactive experience for the user.

Solution: The solution is to create a digital pet that the students can take care of. This will emulate how they should care for themselves and implement known mental health measures proven to reduce stress (such as meditation). The system will have three methods: sleep, play and study. The system will also have a statistics page where users can reflect on their progress.

Sleep: This will utilise the photoresistor to measure light intensity. The animations will depict the pet being asleep and an LED will fade in and out to mimick breathing patterns. If the light levels are too high, the pet will "wake up" and an interrupt will be added to the database. A melody will play at the end of the method once the method is complete. 

Play: A game of rock, paper scissors will ensue, allowing the user to pick one of the options accordingly. The system will pick an option random and the user is told whether they won, drew or lost. The animations change accordingly.

Study: This will use the premise of the Pomodoro technique to provide small, much-needed breaks for students when studying. A sound will play via a buzzer, indicating that the student should take a break from studying and interact with the system. The user will then play the rock, paper, scissors game from the Play method. The study session will resume and the user will be encouraged to go back to studying.
